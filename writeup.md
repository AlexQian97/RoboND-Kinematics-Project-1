### Writeup / README

#### 1. Provide a Writeup / README that includes all the rubric points and how you addressed each one.  You can submit your writeup as markdown or pdf.  

You're reading it!

### Kinematic Analysis
#### 1. Run the forward_kinematics demo and evaluate the kr210.urdf.xacro file to perform kinematic analysis of Kuka KR210 robot and derive its DH parameters.

We can refer to the following images for reference.   
![Annotated image][annotated_image]
**Fig. 1** : Shows the link frames(coordinate systems) choosen according to Modified DH convention. `O(i)` is the origin for link i frame, and `X(i)`, `Z(i)` are the X and Z axis correspondingly. Since we are using a right handed coordinate system, `Y(i)` can be calculated according to right hand rule.   


![URDF Image][urdf_annotation]
**Fig. 2** : Shows the reference frames as specified in the URDF file. Here, `Ojointi` represents ith frame origin(also represented by a black triangle). It also shows various distance between these joint positions as specified in URDF. We will be refering to these values in our description for DH parameter table.

 Here's the complete `Modified DH Parameter` table, followed by a step by step explaination of all
 the terms.

Link(i) | alpha(i-1) | a(i-1) | d(i) | q(i) 
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
1 | 0 | 0 | 0.75 | q1
2 | -pi/2 | 0.35 | 0 | q2 - 90
3 | 0 | 1.25 | 0 | q3
4 | -p1/2 | -0.054 | 1.50 | q4
5 | pi/2 | 0 | 0 | q5
6 | -pi/2 | 0 | 0 | q6
7(G) | 0 | 0 | 0.303 | 0

Here,   
`alpha(i-1)` : Angle between Z(i-1) and Z(i) measured along X(i-1)   
`a(i-1)` : Link length, distance between Z(i-1) and Z(i), measured along X(i-1)   
`d(i)`  : Link offset, distance between X(i-1) and X(i), measured along Z(i-1), variable in prismatic joints(there are no prismatic joints in the given problem)   
`q(i)` : Joint angle, Angle between X(i-1), X(i) measured along Z(i), variable in revolute joints.   
Also,   
`Link 7` represents the gripper link, whhich is fixed. It contains left and right grippers(not controlled by IK code.)   

**Link 1 :** `Z0` is *collinear* to `Z1`, `alpha0 = 0`, `a0 = 0`, `d1 = 0.33(joint1.z) + 0.42(joint2.z) = 0.75`, and `q1` is *unknown*.   
**Link 2 :** `Z1` does not intersect `Z2`, and is p


Describe q2 and q7 separately..


Here is an example of how to include an image in your writeup.

#### 2. Using the DH parameter table you derived earlier, create individual transformation matrices about each joint. In addition, also generate a generalized homogeneous transform between base_link and gripper_link using only end-effector(gripper) pose.

Here's | A | Snappy | Table
--- | --- | --- | ---
1 | `highlight` | **bold** | 7.41
2 | a | b | c
3 | *italic* | text | 403
4 | 2 | 3 | abcd

#### 3. Decouple Inverse Kinematics problem into Inverse Position Kinematics and inverse Orientation Kinematics; doing so derive the equations to calculate all individual joint angles.

And here's another image!

### Project Implementation

#### 1. Fill in the `IK_server.py` file with properly commented python code for calculating Inverse Kinematics based on previously performed Kinematic Analysis. Your code must guide the robot to successfully complete 8/10 pick and place cycles. Briefly discuss the code you implemented and your results. 


Here I'll talk about the code, what techniques I used, what worked and why, where the implementation might fail and how I might improve it if I were going to pursue this project further.  


And just for fun, another example image:
